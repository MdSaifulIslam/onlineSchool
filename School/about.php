                Welcome to the Patuakhali Science and Technology University. It is one of the fast growing  public university in Bangladesh. The university was inaugurated on 08 July 2000 by the then Honorable Prime Minister, Government of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh, Her Excellency Sheikh Hasina and started its academic activities on 26 February 2002. The main campus of the PSTU is located at about 20 km north from the district town of Patuakhali and about 38 km south from the divisional city of Barishal. The outer campus is situated at Babuganj under Barishal district. Being the lone university in the southern region of the country, the PSTU was established primarily to facilitate easy access to quality higher education to a populace who had been deprived of this prime right for a very long time since the independence of our beloved country.

                The up-to-date and well-conformed syllabi have been tailored to the market needs and are designed to equip the students with latest development in their fields of specialization. Moreover, the academic programmes are adopted with commitment to provide and mentoring our students a global career by the updated curricula. We, therefore, present an environment for teaching, research and entrepreneurship development in various disciplines of the university. We believe our success lies in our passion for teaching and learning and our commitment to our students. Our challenge for the future is to build on this strong base to establish ourselves firmly among the leading universities.
