                Welcome to the Patuakhali Science and Technology University.
                It is one of the fast growing new public universities in Bangladesh. 
                The university was inaugurated on 08 July 2000 by the then Honorable Prime Minister, 
                Government of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh, Her Excellency Sheikh Hasina and 
                started its academic activities on 26 February 2002. The main campus of the PSTU is
                located at about 20 km north from the district town of Patuakhali and about 38 km 
                south from the divisional city of Barishal. The outer campus is situated at Babuganj
                under Barishal district. Being the lone university in the southern region of the 
                country, the PSTU was established primarily to facilitate easy access to
                quality higher education to a populace who had been deprived of this prime right 
                for a very long time since the independence of our beloved country. Although situated
                in a remote area, the PSTU campus is 
                surrounded by the traditional artistic radiant and vibrant
                green texture of Bangladesh. 
            </p>

                 The interior of the campus is beautifully decorated with different  
                 types of natural wild plants, medicinal plants and fruit bearing trees 
                 including rows of coconut and mehegoni trees. There are number of lakes
                 and ponds inside the campus which have enhanced its beauty many folds.
                 Despite having comparatively small campus, along with the academic 
                 activities, the students of the university have ample opportunities 
                 to perform different sports and cultural activities. Although the 
                 development activities of the PSTU have been grossly overlooked for many 
                 years since its inception, however, we are gradually advancing towards
                 our goal to attain the status of premier institution in teaching and
                 research.The challenges to our higher education system, particularly 
                 for a university are to curve out a path and a strategy to become an 
                 effective instrument in the process of progressive transformation of 
                 this country. In addition to producing graduates who are highly regarded
                 in the job market, our focus is, therefore, also directed towards creating
                 new knowledge and innovative minds. All the necessary steps are being made 
                 available at present to ensure appropriate environment for performing academic
                 and research activities in a very harmonic situation. We are striving to 
                 instill the sense of right, interest, attitude, morale and intellect in our 
                 students so that they are equipped with the best knowledge, skills, competence 
                 and attitude that they can utilize for their individual betterment and the
                 prosperity of the society in general.
